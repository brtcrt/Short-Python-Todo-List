# Short-Python-Todo-List #
```
in 69 lines of code :)
``` 
- Made this for a school project thingy. 
- Not super efficient but gets the job done. 
- Uses a simple .json database system. 
- The interface was made using tkinter.
- Probably could have been shorter but eh. I can't be bothered.
- I spent like 10 minutes trying to get it from 79 to 69. Totally worth the time.
